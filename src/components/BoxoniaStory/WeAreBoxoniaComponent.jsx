                    In 2019, Wingonia Ikpi identified a gap in the narrative landscape—anurgent need to tell original stories that authentically represent Nigerianand African realities. This industry-wide need laid the foundation for what would become a transformative force in African cinema: Boxonia Blueprint. <br /><br />

                    After a brief hiatus to recalibrate strategies, Boxonia reemerged in March2024, fully operational and poised to deliver groundbreaking media. In the months since, Boxonia Blueprint has produced and co-produced across extensive niches, spanning international collaborations like Son of the Soil and NollyBabes, to dynamic reenactments of classics such as The Godfather and Inglourious Basterds. The portfolio also includes a radio
                    drama on nutrition for INNICROSS/USAID and visually compelling video art for global brands like Unilever and British American Tobacco.<br /><br />

                    As a film and video production powerhouse, Boxonia Blueprint is
                    committed to creating deeply rooted, immersive experiences. The
                    company’s mission is clear: to craft audacious, authentic, and
                    exportable African stories through cinema and other forms of media.
                    With a keen focus on storytelling that resonates across demographics,
                    Boxonia aspires to achieve both cultural impact and commercial success.<br /><br />

                    Boxonia’s core values—ambition, audacity, creativity, innovation, and
                    transparency—have propelled it to become one of the fastest-growing
                    production companies in Africa. Beyond its storytelling expertise, the
                    company operates as a comprehensive hub for film production, offering
                    services such as story development, scripting, intellectual property
                    protection, end-to-end production, marketing, talent management,
                    licensing, and consultancy.<br /><br />

                    Whether it’s working with international collaborators or shaping
                    homegrown narratives, Boxonia Blueprint continues to define itself as a
                    trailblazer in African cinema.
